At [Maven Wave](https://www.mavenwave.com/), I work with some of the world's largest G Suite clients with data migration, deployments, and support. I also develop apps with Google Apps Script and App Maker to give users the tools they need to succeed.

In 2017, I graduated with a B.S. in Management Information Systems from Milwaukee School of Engineering. As part of my year abroad studying in Germany, I also graduated with a degree from the Fachhochschule LÃ¼beck in Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen (Business Engineering).

I have experience administrating Linux, Mac OS, and Windows systems. I am also familiar with Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL-based database systems. I'm passionate about technology and do my best to keep up with all facets of the industry as much as possible, especially concerning security and all things G Suite.
