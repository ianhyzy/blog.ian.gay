Back in 2017, I graduated with a B.S. in Management Information Systems from Milwaukee School of Engineering. As part of my year abroad studying in Germany, I also graduated with a degree from the Fachhochschule LÃ¼beck in Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen (Business Engineering).

After graduating, I worked at [Maven Wave](https://www.mavenwave.com/). I was so happy to work with with some of the world's largest G Suite clients to bring their legacy data to G Suite and ensure their users have an easy transition from their legacy programs. G Suite is a fantastic set of tools for collaboration and I was happy to guide clients through the more complex aspects of configuration to make sure their data is secure and their users are happy and productive.

In February of 2019 I jumped at the chance to work at GrubHub and lead their G Suite and collaboration improvement efforts.

I also develop apps with Google Apps Script to make user's live easier, and App Maker to build time-saving apps at a speed and cost that previously wasn't possible.

I have experience administrating Linux, Mac OS, and Windows systems. I am also familiar with JavaScript, Python, and SQL-based database systems. I'm passionate about technology and do my best to keep up with all facets of the industry as much as possible, especially concerning security and all things G Suite.

Outside of the computer screen, I love to go to movies or go for a bike ride along the lakeshore.
