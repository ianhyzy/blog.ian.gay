##Hosting Info
This is my personal website, which should hopefully show off my talent to potential employers. I use GitHub's free Pages service for hosting and CloudFlare's free protection for SSL. I purchased the domain with Google Domains.
##Tools Used
* [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/): a responsive CSS framework based on Google's Material Design
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for some minor additional functionality. Most browsers should already have it in cache, so it doesn't effect load time.
* I used [Atom](https://atom.io/) as my primary editor due to the extensive built-in plugin database, theme choices, and overall design
* The [GibHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app was the easiest way to manage Git repos
##Other
* Images are compressed with external tools to get the files size down as much as possible without losing quality for most screens.
* The site uses the MIT license so on the remote chance someone else actually wants to use this for something they can.
* Google Analytics is used for tracking people who don't have an adblocker installed
