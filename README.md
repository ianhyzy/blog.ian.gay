My personal website. I use GitHub's free Pages for hosting and CloudFlare's free protection for SSL and anti-DDoS. I purchased the domain with domains.google.

I used [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) as a base when building the site.
Images are compressed with external tools to get the files size down as much as possible without losing quality.

I used Atom as my primary editor due to the theme choices, extensive built-in plugin database, and panel design.
