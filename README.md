My personal website. It's hosted on Digital Ocean and uses Let's Encrypt for SSL.
The site updates from the GitHub repo every 10 minutes automatically.

The site uses the following tools/libraries:
* Google's Material Design Lite
* jQuery
* [jQuery Modal Dialog Plugin For Material Design Lite](http://www.jqueryscript.net/lightbox/jQuery-Modal-Dialog-Plugin-For-Material-Design-Lite.html)

I love the look of Material Design, and MDL is a very easy framework to work with.
It's bare-bones compared to frameworks, but for my purposes for this site that's fine.
