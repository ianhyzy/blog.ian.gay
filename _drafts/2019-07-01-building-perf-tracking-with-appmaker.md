## Summary
Google's App Maker is a new tool to rapidly and easily build apps on Google's App Script platform. It provides an easy way to design web-based UIs, with many built-in components like tables and buttons styled in Gogole's Material Design language. At Maven Wave, our previous employee performance tracking sytem was spreadsheet-based and gorwing harder to  manage as the comapny expanded. A co-worker  suggusted the new App Maker tool could be used to streamline this process, and I jumped at the change to try it  out. 


We worked with HR and the Maven Wave partners to design a prototype, I built a proof of concept applicaton, and then other team built out the additional features needed to bring it to the wider organization in time for end of year performance reviews. The app was rolled out to our triple-digit US based team for the 2018 year.
