## Why are you blogging about Gmail?
I've been using Gmail since about 2010, or possibly before. In 2017 I got a job at Maven Wave, and from answering support tickets to diagnosing complex mail flow issues, I quickly got very aquatinted with the admin side of Gmail for G Suite users (I'm now the G Suite admin at GrubHub).

I'm not a UX designer, I'm not a mail server expert, but I am someone who has used gmail as a consumer, as a corporate user, and as an admin of corporate users, and I have some Thoughtsâ„¢ that I wanted to get down on paper, as much for myself as for others who may have the same questions.

## Why bother thinking about email at all, though?
After using [Hey](../_posts/2020-07-04-hey-vs-gmail.md), I started thinking a lot more about what I like about Gmail, and what drives me crazy. I had always has frustrations with email, but I never really imagined what an alternative would look like - I certainty didn't like the complexity, slowness, and overall clunkiness of outlook, and what else was there? Hey answered the "what else is there" question and jogged my imagination. Real innovation in G Suite has slowed outside of Admin functions, and I wanted to imagine what Gmail would look like if it became unmoored from its past - what would Gmail look like if it was released today?
