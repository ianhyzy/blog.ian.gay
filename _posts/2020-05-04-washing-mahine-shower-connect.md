I recently bought a portable washing machine as I live on a 3rd-floor walkup with unreliable laundry service in the basement. The one snag I hit was that nearly all portable washing machines assume connection to a sink. I didn't have a sink handy, but I did have a showerhead and I was convinced there was a way to do this. 

Quite a bit of internet searching showed other people had done it, but nobody had posted the list of parts you needed to do this. Thanks to two hours in a Home Depot and several helpful employees, here are the things you need to buy from Home Depot:

* [Brass Pipe Coupling 1/2 in FIP (LFA-810)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-2-in-FIP-Lead-Free-Brass-Pipe-Coupling-Fitting-802209/300096268)
* [Garden Hose Adapter 3/4 in MH x 1/2 in MIP (LFA-663)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-MHT-x-1-2-in-MIP-Lead-Free-Brass-Garden-Hose-Adapter-Fitting-801799/207176334)
  * Don't forget the plumber's [tape](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-1-2-in-x-260-in-PTFE-Tape-0178502/202280370) for these parts!
* A [shower head diverter](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Glacier-Bay-3-Way-Diverter-with-Mount-in-Brushed-Nickel-HD3075-544/300353713) that stays in position (some only divert water when the user is exerting force on it).
* A [longer washing machine hose](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-3-4-in-x-3-4-in-x-96-in-Stainless-Steel-Washing-Machine-Hose-7243-96-34-1-EB/205854150). The one that comes with the machine will probably be too short to reach your shower head, my Home Depot had an 8-ft hose near the supplies for washing machines.

For reference, I have the Home Chef [washing machine](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magic-Chef-Compact-0-9-cu-ft-Portable-Top-Load-Washer-in-White-MCSTCW09W1/301140409) and [dryer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magic-Chef-Compact-1-5-cu-ft-Electric-Dryer-in-White-MCSDRY15W/301134985) combo.

Assembly is easy as the parts will only fit one way. Here's what the finished project looks like:
